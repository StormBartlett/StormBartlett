### 🧑🏻‍💻 About 

Full-stack software engineer working end-to-end on modern web products (React/TypeScript, Node, and Python when it earns its keep). I care about secure, well-tested code, fast feedback loops, and shipping features that actually get used.

I work across design, implementation, and deployment: from shaping UX flows and accessible, responsive UIs (React, Next.js, Tailwind, Chrome extensions) to building and hardening backends (Node/Express, Django/Flask, REST, WebSockets, JWT/OAuth). I’m comfortable across PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL, and Firebase Firestore, and I keep pipelines healthy with Git/GitHub, GitHub Actions, and Docker.

Always interested in modern front-end stacks, AI-assisted workflows, and tools that make learning, building, and debugging faster.
